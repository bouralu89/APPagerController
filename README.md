There are several other pods out there that have a similar functionality. However, they come with too many built-in features which I didn't need, and didn't allow deep customization without forking the project, and rewriting whole chunks of them, disabling features, adding others. It just made more sense to create a very basic controller that provides the basic functionality and interaction I was looking for, but gives you complete freedom for customization.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
